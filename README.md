#  Stock Closing Price Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques
##h##
This study focuses on predicting stock closing prices using machine learning techniques, particularly RandomForestRegressor from the scikit-learn library. A collection of Indian stock market data, encompassing various companies such as HDFC Bank Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Reliance Industries Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, and others, is utilized for analysis. The data includes features such as open, high, low, volume, and close prices over time. Initially, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, followed by model training using RandomForestRegressor. The trained model is then used to make predictions on the same dataset. Subsequently, the actual and predicted closing prices are plotted against the date to visually assess the model's performance. This process is automated to generate plots for each stock in the dataset, facilitating comparative analysis of actual and predicted closing prices. Finally, the plots are saved as PNG files for documentation and further analysis. Overall, this study demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in predicting stock prices and provides a systematic approach for analyzing and visualizing the performance of predictive models in the financial domain.
